# A Gentle Introduction to PyO3: Gaussian Blur

This is a simple maturin project that allows you to blur an image using a Rust crate.
The project can be run after building the rustyblur library by the following commands:

```
cd rustyblur
maturin develop
```

And then one can run it from the Python file, `main.py`:

```
python main.py
```
